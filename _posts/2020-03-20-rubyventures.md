If you're interested in becoming a technical writer and/or have any interest in working as a technical writer at a software development company, there's one thing that you should do:

**Learn how to code**. 

Do you need to be an expert? I'd say it depends on your industry, the product you're working on, and your role. Knowing the subject matter is certainly helpful. Having some kind of technical know-how may help you on the job (and in some cases, it may give you an edge over other candidates).

But keep in mind that as a technical writer, you'll often work with subject matter experts (SMEs). These folks have deep knowledge of a particular topic, like software development. They can tell you everything that you need to know about how a process or function works. So if you don't know the answer, they will, so don't be afraid to ask them. 

_But_ it doesn't hurt to know a thing or two about coding yourself.
