If you're interested in becoming a technical writer and/or have any interest in working as a technical writer at a software development company, there's one thing that you should do:

**Learn how to code**. 

Do you need to be an expert? I'd say it depends on your industry, the product you're working on, and your role. Knowing the subject matter is certainly helpful. Even though you'll often work with subject matter experts (SMEs) on the job, it'd be your advantage to have at least one programming language in your tech writer's toolbox, whether it's HTML or Java.

Lately, I've become interested in learning more about [docs as code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/). The philosophy refers to using the same tools to write documentation as you would with code. For example, teams might write their documentation in a markup language like Markdown, store those files in a version control system like Git, and publish with a static site generator (SSG) like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

I was reading Anne Gentle's [Docs Like Code](http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/justwriteclick), which has a nice, simple tutorial that walks you through the steps of using git and GitHub pages to create a website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), another SSG. I did some digging and discovered that Jekyll is written with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), a dynamic, open-source language. 

I did some _more_ digging and discovered that Ruby is a dynamically typed language.

**Dynamically typed vs. Statically typed**: Dynamically typed languages check the types of your variables during runtime. Statically typed variables check the types of your variables during compile time (in other words, before the program runs).
